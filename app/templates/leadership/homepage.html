ership abilities at the house level. Most of them are chosen from the house committees. During the first term of the academic year, they are appointed to be prefects by the principal after being nominated and vetted by the house masters.                                         </p>

The prefects are key to the running of the school. It is they who see that the school rout
ine and school rules are adhered to. They have the authority to punish culprits via the prefect's punishment department. Punishments include washing corridors and rooms, slashing fields and in some extreme cases, working in the school farm or uprooting tree stumps.             </p>

These Captains are allocated various major departments in the school. The school's departments include: <span class = "text-primary">Dining Hall, Entertainment, Games, Compound, Library, Chapel, IT and Links, Medical, Protocol, Utilities, Sponsorship</span>, and <span class = "text-primary">Academic</span>.                                        Each department has its department members which vary with the demands of the department. Each house similarly produces a House Captain to be assisted by his Dorm Prefects.                </p>                                                                                      <img class = "img-rounded" style = 'width : 100%; height : auto;' src = "{{url_for('static', filename = 'prefects_homeimage.jpeg')}}">                                              <p>                                                                               The top five captains are referred to as <span class = "text-primary">the Pentagon</span>.
