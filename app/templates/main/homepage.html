	<h3 class = "text-secondary">Admission</h3>
	<p>Every year, hundreds of thousands of primary school students select to join Alliance High school as their first choice. However, only 300-400 students are selected based on academic merit and quota as per the education policy. Academic merit is based on performance of the K.C.P.E exams. Its quota system sees to it that the school admits boys from every county in the country though with bias to students from public schools as the current education policy requires.
Students are admitted on a need-blind basis. At any given time, there are needy students whose tuition and boarding fees are paid by parties other than their parents or guardians. This is thanks to the schoolâ€™s strong alumni network (the Old Boys Club) as well as the large number of friends the school has around the world.
